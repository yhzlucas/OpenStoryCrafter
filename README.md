# OpenStoryCrafter
OpenStoryCrafter is an open-source, AI-driven story creation toolkit inspired by the application MagicLight AI. The goal of this project is to provide a powerful and easily-extendable framework that enables users to automatically transform scripts, novels, or any form of text into various visual and audio formats, such as comics, animations, or audiobooks.

Through this project, we aim to lower the barrier to content creation, empowering every creative individual to become a "storytelling magician" and effortlessly bring their ideas to life.

# Core Features
# AI Script Analysis & Scene Segmentation:
Intelligently identifies scenes, characters, dialogues, and actions within a script.
Automatically segments long-form text into distinct scenes suitable for visual presentation.

# Multi-Style Image Generation:
Supports a variety of artistic styles (e.g., Japanese Manga, American Comic, Cyberpunk, Ink Wash Painting).
Allows users to upload custom style models or fine-tune the visual style through simple text prompts.

# Character Consistency:
Ensures high consistency in a character's appearance across different scenes and frames using advanced character recognition and locking technology.

# One-Click Generation of Motion Comics/Videos:
Automatically adds camera movements, transitions, and subtitles to the generated static images based on the script.
Supports the import of audio files (e.g., background music, sound effects, voice-overs) and aligns them with the visual timeline.

# Multilingual Support:
Includes a built-in text translation feature to translate scripts into multiple languages and generate corresponding subtitles.

# Plugin-Based Architecture:
Designed with a highly modular structure, making it easy for developers to add new features or models (e.g., integrating new AI image models, text-to-speech engines, etc.).
# Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask/Django

# AI Models:
Text Processing: spaCy, NLTK
Image Generation: Stable Diffusion, Midjourney (API)
