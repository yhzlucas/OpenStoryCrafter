# OpenStoryCrafter

**OpenStoryCrafter** is a **structured AI story planner** that turns outlines into branching dialogue, events, and decisions. It is suitable for both **interactive fiction writers** and **character AI platform developers**.

## ✨ What is OpenStoryCrafter?

OpenStoryCrafter is designed to streamline the creative workflow for narrative-driven experiences by enabling:

- Structuring of scenes, dialogue, and choices in a clean, editable format (YAML/JSON)
- Export to formats ready for integration with AI chat systems, visual novel engines, or branching video generators
- Quick iteration from a high-level outline to richly detailed interactions

Whether you are building a choice-based visual novel, an immersive AI chat app, or a gamified story experience, this tool provides a reliable base.

Inspired by tools like [Magic AI](https://magiclight.ai/) — a platform that bridges imagination and AI-powered visual storytelling — OpenStoryCrafter is also built to adapt to the future of [text to video](https://blog.magiclight.ai/) content creation.

## 🧠 Who Is It For?

- 📝 **Writers of interactive fiction**: Map your story logic, character arcs, and branching events.
- 🎮 **Game developers**: Use the structure to drive event-based game logic or simulated interactions.
- 💕 **AI romantic roleplay creators**: Tailored for integration with [simulated romantic gaming AI](https://reelplay.ai/) experiences.
- 🎬 **AI-generated video creators**: Export structured narratives that feed into video synthesis pipelines.

## 🔧 Core Features

- **Outline-to-Narrative Conversion**: Turn a basic story outline into a complex multi-path storyline.
- **Branching Support**: Easily manage conditional flows, character choices, and variable outcomes.
